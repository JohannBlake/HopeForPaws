# HopeForPaws

An Android demo app submitted to Google's contest "Dev Challenge" for the purpose of showcasing the beta release of Jetpack Compose.

The app displays a list of pets that can be adopted. Clicking on a list item displays details about the pet such as name, gender, age, location, etc.

The app is written entirely in Kotlin and uses only Jetpack Compose to create the UIs. Data is generated on a backend using Wirespec (wirespec.dev). I am also the creator and owner of Wirespec. Wirespec lets you create JSON responses quickly and easily at endpoints that you can define.
